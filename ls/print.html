<h2 id="purpose"><a class="header" href="#purpose">Purpose</a></h2>
<p>At <strong>Incite Literacy</strong>, our purpose is simple: <strong>return agency to the learner</strong>.</p>
<p>Incite Literacy is unscripted, real-world learning driven by curiosity, relevance, and purpose. Our projects are designed to be lived—not just completed—with students taking the lead in shaping what, how, and why they learn.</p>
<p><strong>Sound “vague”? “Too broad”? “Not measurable enough”?</strong><br />
That’s the system talking. You’ve been conditioned to believe that learning must be linear, prepackaged, and testable.</p>
<p>But REAL learning doesn’t work like that.</p>
<p>Curiosity, creativity, and exploration have been suffocated—shrunk down to fit inside rubrics and GPA formulas meant for a world that no longer exists.</p>
<p>At Incite Literacy, we believe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning is a process</strong>—and it should be owned by the learner.</li>
<li><strong>Agency is not optional</strong>—it’s the foundation of future-ready learning.</li>
<li><strong>Growth isn’t standardized</strong>—it’s self-driven, iterative, and personal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’re not here to prescribe your path.</strong>
We’re here to help you discover what matters to <em>you</em>—and give you the tools to build from there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We won’t tell you what to do.</strong><br />
We’ll help you figure out what <em>you</em> want to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We won’t tell you how to do it.</strong><br />
The challenge (and the joy) is in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We won’t tell you when you’re done.</strong><br />
You decide when the work is real, relevant, and ready.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <em>your</em> learning.</p>
<p><strong>Own it. Shape it. Incite it.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="core-principle"><a class="header" href="#core-principle">Core Principle</a></h2>
<p>At the heart of Incite Literacy is the unshakeable conviction that ALL people are born to learn and do - without limits.</p>
<p>No one is expected to have all of the answers; however, ALL people have the opportunity to explore, take risks, and make mistakes without being penalized.</p>
<p>Incite Literacy is here to ignite in you what is already there.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-doesnt-kill-you-makes-you-ready"><a class="header" href="#what-doesnt-kill-you-makes-you-ready">What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You… Ready.</a></h2>
<p><strong>Incite Literacy is here to move you toward the future.</strong><br />
But let’s be honest: nothing worth your time, effort, blood, sweat, or tears comes easy.</p>
<p>Real learning is frustrating.<br />
You’ll second-guess yourself.<br />
You’ll have near misses and total wins.<br />
And through it all, you’ll <em>feel</em> learning—maybe for the first time.</p>
<p>We believe that discomfort is the part of learning you’ve been missing all along.<br />
You’ve needed something that moves you, challenges you, lights a fire in you.<br />
That doesn’t come without struggle.</p>
<p>You’ll have to learn how to sit with that struggle.<br />
Push through it.<br />
Grow because of it.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="if-youre-a-parent"><a class="header" href="#if-youre-a-parent">If you're a parent...</a></h3>
<p>Your child might feel stuck.<br />
Paralyzed by the freedom they’ve never had.<br />
And that will make <em>you</em> uncomfortable, too.</p>
<p>Because watching them wrestle with learning—without a structure to fall back on—is hard.<br />
It’s not what we’ve been taught learning looks like.<br />
But it <em>is</em> what real growth feels like.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="ask-yourself"><a class="header" href="#ask-yourself">Ask yourself:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>What do you want?</li>
<li>What do you believe?</li>
<li>What kind of life are you building?</li>
<li>Who are <em>you</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can sit with those questions—and let them shape your learning—<br />
you’re already doing the work.</p>

It produces box-checkers, not adaptable, critical thinkers.</p>

<h2 id="what-success-looks-like-at-incite-literacy"><a class="header" href="#what-success-looks-like-at-incite-literacy">## What Success Looks Like at Incite Literacy</a></h2>
<h3 id="at-incite-literacy-success-isnt-about-test-scores-or-report-cards"><a class="header" href="#at-incite-literacy-success-isnt-about-test-scores-or-report-cards">At Incite Literacy, success isn’t about test scores or report cards.</a></h3>
<p>Success looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Launching a podcast</strong> that tells your story, shares your passion, and builds an audience that grows with you.</li>
<li><strong>Designing a prototype</strong>—an app, product, or service—that solves a real-world problem, then pitching it to a business, investor, or community group.</li>
<li><strong>Publishing your first book</strong>—a short story, memoir, or poetry collection—in two languages, and building a following that actually <em>reads</em> your work.</li>
<li><strong>Creating a digital brand</strong> that reflects your interests—whether it’s gaming, fashion, fitness, food, or activism—and learning how to grow it with purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Exploring business</strong> not through textbooks, but by launching a mini startup, selling a product, or building a solution people actually need.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborating with a team</strong> to create something bigger than yourself—something you can point to and say, “We built that. That’s ours.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Success is learners owning their path, building with purpose, and growing through challenge—not in spite of it.</p>
<p><strong>But here’s the catch — none of this works unless you do.</strong></p>
<p>Success isn’t handed to you. If you’re waiting for someone to push you, you’ll always be behind. The most successful people in the world take control of their learning. They create opportunities instead of waiting for them.</p>
<p><strong>If that sounds like you, you’re in the right place.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-is-this-possible"><a class="header" href="#how-is-this-possible">How is this possible?</a></h2>
<p>At Incite Literacy, we use <strong>Project-Based Learning (PBL)</strong> and <strong>Design Thinking (DT)</strong>—two flexible, real-world frameworks that guide how you approach any learning experience.</p>
<p>They give you a clear, adaptable process that helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the <em>why</em> behind your project — what problem are you solving, and why does it matter?</li>
<li>Identify <em>who</em> is impacted — your audience, users, collaborators, or community</li>
<li>Define the <em>steps</em> you’ll take — from research to brainstorming, building, and refining</li>
<li>Decide <em>how</em> to bring it to life — what tools, resources, or strategies you’ll use</li>
<li>Reflect on <em>what worked</em> and <em>what didn’t</em> — so you can improve, adapt, and grow</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes Incite Literacy different is that you're given the time, space, and support that <em>real learning</em> requires.</p>
<p>Deadlines exist—but they’re there to help you learn <strong>how to manage your time</strong>, not punish you when things take longer than expected.</p>
<p>You’re going to make mistakes.<br />
Things won’t always go as planned.<br />
And that’s not just okay—it’s part of the process.</p>
<p>When things fall apart, you try again.<br />
You reflect, adjust, and move forward.</p>
<p>That’s how deep learning happens.<br />
That’s how confidence is built.<br />
That’s how you grow.</p>

<p>At Incite Literacy, you don’t wait to be taught.<br />
You learn how to <strong>lead your own learning</strong>.</p>
<p>That might sound scary. Most people aren’t used to it.<br />
But here’s the truth: <strong>you already have what it takes.</strong><br />
You just haven’t been given the chance—or the tools—until now.</p>
<p>You’ll work independently or with a team.<br />
You’ll have the option to check in with a <strong>facilitator</strong>—not a teacher handing out instructions, but a guide who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports you when you hit a wall</li>
<li>Helps you reflect, revise, and regroup</li>
<li>Checks in to keep you focused, motivated, and moving forward</li>
</ul>
<p>They won’t do the work for you.<br />
They’ll help you figure out <strong>how to do it for yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>You’ll learn to trust your voice, your ideas, and your process.<br />
And when something fails? That’s just your next launch point.</p>
<p>This is what real learning feels like.<br />
<strong>You're not waiting for help. You're becoming the kind of person who knows how to find it, ask for it, or build it themselves.</strong></p>

<p>While they share common values, they serve different purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project-Based Learning (PBL)</strong> provides structure. Students learn by doing—working through meaningful, real-world projects from start to finish.</li>
<li><strong>Design Thinking (DT)</strong> adds a creative process. Students use empathy, research, prototyping, and feedback to design solutions that matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Used together, they create a powerful experience: students don’t just complete projects—they solve problems that make an impact.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-you-use-both-project-based-learning-and-design-thinking"><a class="header" href="#why-do-you-use-both-project-based-learning-and-design-thinking">**Why do you use both Project-Based Learning and Design Thinking?</a></h3>
<p>We don’t use them at the same time—we use them in stages.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Project-Based Learning (PBL)</strong><br />
We start with PBL to help students get used to thinking creatively, building confidence, and working through structured, real-world projects. It’s a great starting point for those coming from traditional classrooms or just getting started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase 2: Hybrid Approach</strong><br />
In this middle stage, students start influencing the process—choosing topics or shaping how they approach a challenge. This phase blends the structure of PBL with the creative flexibility of Design Thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase 3: Design Thinking (DT)</strong><br />
Once students are ready, they use the full Design Thinking framework to lead their own projects—independently identifying problems, exploring solutions, and building meaningful outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Used together, they create a powerful experience: students don’t just complete projects—they solve problems that make an impact.</p>
<p>This progression helps students build the mindset and skills they need to confidently own their learning journey.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-students-stay-on-track-without-a-traditional-structure"><a class="header" href="#how-do-students-stay-on-track-without-a-traditional-structure">How do students stay on track without a traditional structure?</a></h3>
<p>We offer <strong>freedom within structure</strong>. Students have choice in what they pursue, but every project includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear expectations</li>
<li>Checkpoints and feedback loops</li>
<li>Support from mentors and peers</li>
</ul>
<p>This helps students build independence <em>with</em> guidance—not without it.</p>
