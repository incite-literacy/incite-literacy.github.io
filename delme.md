## Best Practices at Incite Literacy

Our learning model is built on action, reflection, and ownership. Here’s how we make it real:

### 1. Start with a Real Problem 🌍  
Every project begins with a real-world question or challenge. If it doesn’t matter in real life, we don’t waste time on it.

### 2. Build, Test, Repeat 🔁  
Progress beats perfection. Learners create, revise, and grow through feedback and iteration.

### 3. Use AI as a Thinking Partner 🤖  
AI isn’t a shortcut—it’s a tool for exploring ideas, testing thinking, and improving work.

### 4. Show Your Work 📁  
No grades. No tests. Just a portfolio of real projects that prove what you can do.

### 5. Own Your Path 🧭  
You choose the project. We guide the process. Learn what you care about—and where you want to go.

We blend **Project-Based Learning** and **Design Thinking** to help you go from idea to impact.
