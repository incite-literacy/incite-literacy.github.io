## Purpose

At **Incite Literacy**, our purpose is simple: **return agency to the learner**.

Incite Literacy is unscripted, real-world learning driven by curiosity, relevance, and purpose. Our projects are designed to be lived—not just completed—with students taking the lead in shaping what, how, and why they learn.

 **Sound “vague”? “Too broad”? “Not measurable enough”?**  
 That’s the system talking. You’ve been conditioned to believe that learning must be linear, prepackaged, and testable.

But REAL learning doesn’t work like that.

Curiosity, creativity, and exploration have been suffocated—shrunk down to fit inside rubrics and GPA formulas meant for a world that no longer exists.

At Incite Literacy, we believe:

- **Learning is a process**—and it should be owned by the learner.  
- **Agency is not optional**—it’s the foundation of future-ready learning.  
- **Growth isn’t standardized**—it’s self-driven, iterative, and personal.  

**We’re not here to prescribe your path.**
We’re here to help you discover what matters to *you*—and give you the tools to build from there.

>**We won’t tell you what to do.**  
>We’ll help you figure out what *you* want to do.

>**We won’t tell you how to do it.**  
>The challenge (and the joy) is in the process.

>**We won’t tell you when you’re done.**  
>You decide when the work is real, relevant, and ready.

This is *your* learning. 

**Own it. Shape it. Incite it.**

## Core Principle

At the heart of Incite Literacy is the unshakeable conviction that ALL people are born to learn and do - without limits. 

No one is expected to have all of the answers; however, ALL people have the opportunity to explore, take risks, and make mistakes without being penalized.   

Incite Literacy is here to ignite in you what is already there.

## What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You… Ready.

**Incite Literacy is here to move you toward the future.**  
But let’s be honest: nothing worth your time, effort, blood, sweat, or tears comes easy.

Real learning is frustrating.  
You’ll second-guess yourself.  
You’ll have near misses and total wins.  
And through it all, you’ll *feel* learning—maybe for the first time.

We believe that discomfort is the part of learning you’ve been missing all along.  
You’ve needed something that moves you, challenges you, lights a fire in you.  
That doesn’t come without struggle.

You’ll have to learn how to sit with that struggle.  
Push through it.  
Grow because of it.

### If you're a parent...

Your child might feel stuck.  
Paralyzed by the freedom they’ve never had.  
And that will make *you* uncomfortable, too.

Because watching them wrestle with learning—without a structure to fall back on—is hard.  
It’s not what we’ve been taught learning looks like.  
But it *is* what real growth feels like.

---

### Ask yourself:

- What do you want?  
- What do you believe?  
- What kind of life are you building?  
- Who are *you*?

If you can sit with those questions—and let them shape your learning—  
you’re already doing the work.

### At Incite Literacy:

> There’s no such thing as failure.
> Only feedback. Only forward.

If you’re ready to take control of your learning, you’re in the right place.
