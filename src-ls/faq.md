### **Why do you use both Project-Based Learning and Design Thinking? Arenâ€™t they the same?

While they share common values, they serve different purposes:

- **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** provides structure. Students learn by doingâ€”working through meaningful, real-world projects from start to finish.
- **Design Thinking (DT)** adds a creative process. Students use empathy, research, prototyping, and feedback to design solutions that matter.

Used together, they create a powerful experience: students donâ€™t just complete projectsâ€”they solve problems that make an impact.

### **Why do you use both Project-Based Learning and Design Thinking?

We donâ€™t use them at the same timeâ€”we use them in stages. 

- **Phase 1: Project-Based Learning (PBL)**  
  We start with PBL to help students get used to thinking creatively, building confidence, and working through structured, real-world projects. Itâ€™s a great starting point for those coming from traditional classrooms or just getting started.

- **Phase 2: Hybrid Approach**  
  In this middle stage, students start influencing the processâ€”choosing topics or shaping how they approach a challenge. This phase blends the structure of PBL with the creative flexibility of Design Thinking.

- **Phase 3: Design Thinking (DT)**  
  Once students are ready, they use the full Design Thinking framework to lead their own projectsâ€”independently identifying problems, exploring solutions, and building meaningful outcomes.

Used together, they create a powerful experience: students donâ€™t just complete projectsâ€”they solve problems that make an impact.

This progression helps students build the mindset and skills they need to confidently own their learning journey. 
### How do students stay on track without a traditional structure?

We offer **freedom within structure**. Students have choice in what they pursue, but every project includes:

- Clear expectations  
- Checkpoints and feedback loops  
- Support from mentors and peers  

This helps students build independence *with* guidanceâ€”not without it.
