# 📅 A Week in the Life at Incite Literacy  
*Designed for agency, fueled by curiosity, guided by support.*

Every learner’s week looks a little different. Here’s a realistic look at how one student might move through a project-based week at Incite Literacy:

At the beginning of each new project cycle, you’ll have the opportunity to **pitch your idea** to fellow learners or explore your ideas on your own. The choice is yours. If others are interested, you can form a team and collaborate. Project pitches and team formation happens inside **Discourse**, our online hub for connecting, posting updates, and learning from one another.

## Monday

**🧠 Independent Work (2–3 hrs)**  
Kick off the week by reviewing your project goals and making a game plan. Use AI to outline your approach—whether it’s a solo build or a team effort.

**📅 Optional 1-on-1 with Facilitator**  
Book a check-in to clarify your direction and get feedback before you dive in.

**📢 Pitch Your Project**  
Starting something new? Share your idea on Discourse to invite collaboration. Others can comment, ask questions, or offer to join.

🚀 **Be Fearless**
Incite Literacy is designed for you to take risks. Got an idea or interest? 💡 Pitch it—see where it lands. Will every idea be great? ❌ Nope. Doesn’t matter. What matters is just getting started. 

This isn’t school. 📚 You won’t get penalized for trying.  Don’t wait for perfect. Just start.

## Wednesday

**🔍 Refine & Iterate (1–2 hrs)**  
Use feedback from Tuesday’s session to strengthen your work. AI tools can help improve your structure, language, or design.

**🧑‍🏫 Facilitator Support (Optional)**  
Book a 1-on-1 to get detailed help or to refocus if you're stuck.

**🤝 Team Sync (if applicable)**

**💬 Open Discussion (1 hr)**  
Choose a **morning, afternoon, or both** sessions to share updates, troubleshoot issues, and contribute to others' learning.

**🎯 Focus Work (2–3 hrs)**

---

## Friday

**🛠️ Polish & Publish (1–2 hrs)**  
Finalize your project for the week. Whether it’s a deliverable, a blog post, or a concept prototype, make it clean and clear. Use AI to double-check grammar, logic, or presentation.

**📣 Share & Reflect (1 hr)**  
Post your progress on Discourse, tag your team (if any), and reflect on what worked, what didn’t, and what’s next.
