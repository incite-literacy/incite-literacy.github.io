## **Project Based Learning and Design Thinking as Frameworks**  
<!-- toc -->
Both **Project Based Learning (PBL) and Design Thinking (DT) provide structured processes** that guide learning.  

> **PBL as a Framework**: Provides a structured sequence (*problem introduction → inquiry → creation → presentation*) that helps students develop solutions systematically.  

> **DT as a Framework**: Provides a step-by-step process (*empathize → define → ideate → prototype → test*) for problem-solving and innovation.  

## Project Based Learning vs. Design Thinking: Side-by-Side Comparison

| **Step** | **Project-Based Learning (PBL)**                                                                                  | **Design Thinking (DT)**                                                                                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | 👀 **Find a real problem**: What’s something happening in the world or your life that you want to fix or improve? | **👥 Get to know the people you're helping**: Talk to people, ask questions, and listen to understand what they really need. |
| **2**    | 📋 **Plan your idea**: Look into the problem, come up with ideas, and decide how to solve it.                     | **🚩 Figure out the real problem**: Based on what you heard, decide what challenge you really want to focus on.              |
| **3**    | 🛠️**Build it**: Create something (like a video, poster, product, or event) to show your idea in action.          | **💡Think of lots of ideas**: Brainstorm as many ways as possible to solve the problem—don’t hold back!                      |
| **4**    | 🤸🏽 **Try it out and improve**: Show your work, get feedback, and make it better.                                | **🌀 Make a model**: Build a rough version of your idea (a prototype) you can test quickly.                                  |
| **5**    | 📤👥 **Share your work**: Show your finished project to an audience or group that cares about the problem.        | **🧑🏽‍🔬 Test it with real people**: See how people react to your prototype and use what you learn to make it stronger.     |
|          |                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                              |
## Key Differences

- **PBL** is anchored in a **driving question** and emphasizes **process over product**.  It focuses on producing a final product or solution based on a defined problem. 

- **Design Thinking** starts with **empathy** and revolves around **iterative innovation**.  It focuses on understanding users and iterating solutions, often leading to multiple prototypes rather than a single finished product. 

- **PBL** fits well in **academic settings**, while **DT** thrives in **creative, entrepreneurial, or user-focused problem-solving**.  

- At **Incite Literacy**, both are blended to empower learners to **solve real problems for real people**—starting from **structure (PBL)** and evolving toward **creativity (DT)**.
