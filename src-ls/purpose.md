## 🔥 Purpose 

At **Incite Literacy**, our purpose is simple: **return agency to the learner**.

Incite Literacy is unscripted, real-world learning driven by curiosity, relevance, and purpose. Our projects are designed to be lived—not just completed—with students taking the lead in shaping what, how, and why they learn.

 **Sound “vague”? “Too broad”? “Not measurable enough”?**  
 That’s the system talking. You’ve been conditioned to believe that learning must be linear, prepackaged, and testable.

But REAL learning doesn’t work like that.

Curiosity, creativity, and exploration have been suffocated—shrunk down to fit inside rubrics and GPA formulas meant for a world that no longer exists.

At Incite Literacy, we believe:

- **🧠 Learning is a process**—and it should be owned by the learner.  
- **✊🏽 Agency is not optional**—it’s the foundation of future-ready learning.  
- **🌱 Growth isn’t standardized**—it’s self-driven, iterative, and personal.
