## 🧭 Who’s in Charge? You Are.

At Incite Literacy, you don’t wait to be taught.  
You learn how to **lead your own learning**. 🚀

That might sound scary. Most people aren’t used to it.  
But here’s the truth: **you already have what it takes.** 💪  
You just haven’t been given the chance—or the tools—until now. 🧰

You’ll work independently or with a team 🤝.  
You’ll have the option to check in with a **facilitator** 🧑‍🏫—not a teacher handing out instructions, but a guide who:

- 🧗 Supports you when you hit a wall  
- 🔁 Helps you reflect, revise, and regroup  
- 🎯 Checks in to keep you focused, motivated, and moving forward  

They won’t do the work for you.  
They’ll help you figure out **how to do it for yourself**. 🛠️

You’ll learn to trust your voice, your ideas, and your process. 🗣️ 
And when something fails? That’s just your next launch point. 🚀

This is what real learning feels like.  
**You're not waiting for help. You're becoming the kind of person who knows how to find it, ask for it, or build it themselves.** 🔥
