## 🧭 Who’s in Charge? You Are.

At Incite Literacy, you don’t wait to be taught.  
You learn how to **lead your own learning**—like a founder, a director, a builder. 🚀

That might sound intimidating. Most people have never had that kind of control.  
But here’s the truth: **you already have what it takes.** 💪  
You just haven’t had the space—or the tools—until now. 🧰

You’ll choose the problems you want to solve and the ideas you want to explore.  
You’ll decide how to approach your project—and who, if anyone, to team up with. 🤝

You’ll also have access to a **facilitator**—not a teacher with a checklist, but a guide who:

- 🧗 Helps you navigate roadblocks when things get tough  
- 🔁 Asks questions that help you reflect, revise, and keep moving  
- 🎯 Supports your process, not just your product  

Facilitators won’t assign the work—or rescue you from the hard parts.  
They’ll help you develop the skills to **figure it out**, make decisions, and stay on track. 🛠️

You’ll get used to making choices.  
Pitching ideas.  
Asking for feedback.  
Deciding what success looks like—for you.

And when something doesn’t go the way you planned?  
That’s not failure. That’s your next launch point. 🚀

This is what real learning feels like.  
You’re not waiting for permission. You’re **learning how to build, ask, adapt, and lead**.

>**Learning starts when *you* do—so go.**

<summary>🔎 What This Looks Like in Action</summary>

- You wake up with an idea for a digital zine. You pitch it in Discourse to see if anyone wants to join. Two learners respond. You start a thread.  
- You sketch a rough outline and message your facilitator to schedule a check-in. They don’t give you answers—they ask questions that help you focus.  
- Midweek, your team hits a wall: your zine layout tool isn’t working. You research alternatives, test a new platform, and update your plan.  
- By Friday, you’ve published your first version. It’s not perfect. But it’s real, it’s yours, and you already have ideas for version two.

- You’ve always wanted to write a personal essay but never had the time—or the right audience.  
- You choose a prompt, brainstorm ideas, and use AI to organize your thoughts.  
- You write a draft, then schedule a check-in with your facilitator to talk through structure and tone.  
- After some helpful feedback, you revise, format, and publish it on your own blog.  
- You reflect on what worked and what you’d do differently next time—because there will be a next time.
