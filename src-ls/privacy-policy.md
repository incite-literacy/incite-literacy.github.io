## Cookies

Like many websites, the services may use cookies to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our site. Cookies are used most commonly to do things like tracking page views, identifying repeat users and utilizing login tokens for a session.

The services use session cookies to anonymously track a user’s session on the services to deliver a better experience. You can block or delete these cookies through your browser’s settings.

You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our services though your access to some functionality may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.

## Data Transfers

Use of the services is voluntary and users may choose whether or not they wish to use them. Because we offer our services to people in different countries and use technical infrastructure based in the United States, we may need to transfer your personal information across borders in order to deliver our services.

## Information Security

We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the privacy and security of the information we maintain about you. The connection between your computer and our servers is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software that encrypts that information. We use a digital certificate and secure pages will be identified by a padlock sign and “https://” in the address bar.

However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us cannot be guaranteed.

## Your Rights

Upon request, we will provide users with information about whether we hold any of their personal information. In certain cases, subject to relevant legal rights, users have the right to object to the processing of their personal information, to request changes, corrections, or the deletion of their personal information, and to obtain a copy of their personal information in an easily accessible format. In order to do this, users can contact us using the contact information set out at the bottom of this policy. We will respond to every request within a reasonable timeframe and may need to take reasonable steps to confirm identity before proceeding.

You can also withdraw your consent to our processing of your information and the use of our services, and/or delete your user account at any time, by using the contact information below to request that your personal information be deleted. If you are an EU resident and believe that our processing of your personal data is contrary to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority.

If you withdraw your consent to the use or sharing of your personal information for the purposes set out in this policy, we may not be able to provide you with our services. Please note that in certain cases we may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn consent and requested that we delete your information if we have a legal basis/need to do so.

## Data Retention

For personal data under its control, we will retain such data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this policy, or as needed to provide users with our services.

If a user no longer wishes to use our services then it may request deletion of its data at any time.

Notwithstanding the above, we will retain and use user information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may also retain log files for the purpose of internal analysis, for site safety, security and fraud prevention, to improve site functionality, or where we are legally required to retain them for longer time periods.

## Children's Privacy

The services are not directed to children and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of sixteen. If you are under the age of sixteen, your parent or guardian must provide their consent for you to use the services.

## Third-party Services

We use third-party services. See the third-party service's privacy policy if you have questions, comments or concerns.
