### How You Will Learn It

We use [**Project-Based Learning (PBL)** and **Design Thinking (DT)**](project-based-learning-and-design-thinking.md) to help you take ownership of your learning.  

From beginning to end you're driving the learning process. 

---

### Step 1: Start With a Problem That Matters
You’ll start with a real-world challenge—something worth solving, building, or exploring. You’ll ask:  
*What matters to me? Who needs this? Why now?*

---

### Step 2: Plan Your Approach
You’ll map out how you want to tackle the challenge.  
That means identifying your audience, setting your goals, deciding what tools you need, and figuring out your timeline.

---

### Step 3: Build, Create, Experiment
Now the work begins. You might write, design, code, record, pitch, interview, prototype, revise—or all of the above.  
You’ll apply skills in language, tech, business, and more.

---

### Step 4: Reflect and Revise
Things will go wrong. That’s expected.  
You’ll pause, reflect, make changes, and try again.  
This is how you get better—not by getting it “right” the first time.

---

### Step 5: Share What You’ve Made
You’ll present your work to a real audience—classmates, parents, professionals, or even the public.  
Your learning doesn’t end with a grade. It ends with a result.

---

### Support Without Hand-Holding
You’re not alone in this.  
**Facilitators** will check in, guide you through obstacles, offer feedback, and help you keep moving.  
But you’re in charge of your learning—not them.

---

### Why It Works
You won’t just know more—you’ll *be and do more*.  
More confident. More capable. More ready for what’s next.  
This is learning that builds your future.
