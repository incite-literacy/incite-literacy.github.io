# 🧠 The Learning Models We Use (and Why They Work)

At Incite Literacy, we use two powerful frameworks—**Project-Based Learning (PBL)** and **Design Thinking (DT)**—to guide your learning in a way that’s structured, creative, and real-world focused.

These models grow with you. You’ll start with PBL to build confidence, then move into DT as you’re ready to take more creative control.

## 🧱 Project-Based Learning (PBL)

PBL is the starting point.  
You’ll choose a meaningful project and work through it step-by-step, with support and feedback along the way.

It’s about building skills like:

- 📚 Research and critical thinking  
- 🗣️ Communication and collaboration  
- 🎯 Time management and self-direction  

You’ll learn by doing—and create work that matters to you.

## 🌀 Design Thinking (DT)

Once you’ve gained experience, you’ll shift into DT.  
This model is more open-ended and creative. It helps you design real solutions with real people in mind.

DT teaches you how to:

- 🧭 Start with empathy and user research  
- 🎨 Generate bold ideas and test them  
- 🔁 Refine your work through feedback  
- 🚀 Create real-world impact

## 🤖 Where AI Fits In

From the beginning, you’ll learn how to use tools like **ChatGPT**, **Canva**, **Notion**, and more to support your thinking—not replace it.

AI helps you:

- Brainstorm ideas  
- Organize research  
- Draft and edit content  
- Design visuals and presentations  
- Reflect and improve your work

You’ll learn to use AI as a collaborator—so your ideas, voice, and creativity stay in the lead.

## 🔄 A Flexible Learning Path

You don’t need to be an expert to begin.  
Start with a clear structure, grow your skills, and move into creative problem solving when you're ready.  
It’s all supported, step-by-step—and built around what matters to you.
