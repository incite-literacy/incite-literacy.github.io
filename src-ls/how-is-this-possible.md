## How is this possible?

At Incite Literacy, we use **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** 🛠️ and **Design Thinking (DT)** 🧠 — two flexible, real-world frameworks that guide how you approach any learning experience.

They give you a clear, adaptable process that helps you:

- 🔍 Understand the **why** behind your project — what problem are you solving, and why does it matter?  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Identify **who** is impacted — your audience, users, collaborators, or community  
- 🗺️ **Define the steps** you’ll take — from research to brainstorming, building, and refining  
- 🧰 Decide **how** to bring it to life — what tools, resources, or strategies you’ll use  
- 🔁 Reflect on **what worked** and **what didn’t** — so you can improve, adapt, and grow  

💡 What makes Incite Literacy different is that you're given the time, space, and support that real learning requires.
