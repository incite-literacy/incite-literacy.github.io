# 🛠️ How We Make This Happen

### You’ve seen what success looks like.  
Here’s how we help you get there.

Incite Literacy uses **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** and **Design Thinking (DT)**—two proven, flexible frameworks that put you in charge of your learning while giving you the structure to succeed.

This isn’t about worksheets or lectures.  
It’s about working on real challenges with the tools that matter.
