### How does AI fit into the learning experience?  

AI is your assistant, not your replacement. Youâ€™ll use it to research, automate tasks, and enhance your workâ€”just like professionals do.  

---
### What makes Incite Literacy different from traditional schools?  

We donâ€™t believe in memorization, busywork, or standardized tests. Instead, we focus on helping you discover what matters to you, integrating real-world skills, using AI-powered learning, and compiling a projects portfolio to showcase your knowledge, skills, and most importantly what drive you. 

---
### How does this prepare me for the workforce?  

Youâ€™ll walk away with tangible projects, AI expertise, and problem-solving skillsâ€”everything employers and entrepreneurs actually value.

### Why do you use both Project-Based Learning and Design Thinking?

We donâ€™t use them at the same timeâ€”we use them in stages. 

While they share common values, they serve different purposes:

- **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** provides structure. Students learn by doingâ€”working through meaningful, real-world projects from start to finish.
- **Design Thinking (DT)** adds a creative process. Students use empathy, research, prototyping, and feedback to design solutions that matter.

- **Phase 1: Project-Based Learning (PBL)**  
  We start with PBL to help students get used to thinking creatively, building confidence, and working through structured, real-world projects. Itâ€™s a great starting point for those coming from traditional classrooms or just getting started.

- **Phase 2: Hybrid Approach**  
  In this middle stage, students start influencing the processâ€”choosing topics or shaping how they approach a challenge. This phase blends the structure of PBL with the creative flexibility of Design Thinking.

- **Phase 3: Design Thinking (DT)**  
  Once students are ready, they use the full Design Thinking framework to lead their own projectsâ€”independently identifying problems, exploring solutions, and building meaningful outcomes.

Used together, they create a powerful experience: students donâ€™t just complete projectsâ€”they solve problems that make an impact.

This progression helps students build the mindset and skills they need to confidently own their learning journey. 

---
### How do students stay on track without a traditional structure?

We offer **freedom within structure**. Students have choice in what they pursue, but every project includes:

- Clear expectations  
- Checkpoints and feedback loops  
- Support from mentors and peers  

This helps students build independence *with* guidanceâ€”not without it.

### How do you assess student learning without tests or grades?**

How do you know theyâ€™re learning anything?


We use authentic assessmentâ€”projects, portfolios, reflections, and feedback. Students show what theyâ€™ve learned by building, not bubbling in answers. Itâ€™s not about memorizingâ€”itâ€™s about applying knowledge in meaningful ways. The proof is in the product.

---

### How do you keep students on track without rigid structure?

Isnâ€™t this too unstructured for some learners?

Thereâ€™s freedom within structure. Every project includes checkpoints, feedback cycles, and clear deliverables. Students choose their path, but they donâ€™t walk it aloneâ€”they get guided support throughout.

---

### How is AI used without encouraging dependency or cheating?

Is this just another shortcut for students?

AI is taught as a thinking partner, not a replacement for thinking. Students learn when to use AI, how to question it, and how to build on top of what it gives. We emphasize critical useâ€”fact-checking, refining, and remixingâ€”not copy-pasting.

---

### Isnâ€™t this just for high-achieving or highly motivated students?

Can all students succeed in this model?

The model is built for all learnersâ€”especially those who havenâ€™t thrived in traditional systems. Itâ€™s designed to engage curiosity, build confidence, and reward effort and growth. The work is personalized, and success looks different for each studentâ€”but everyone is capable of building something meaningful.
