# 🔗 Aligning Focus Areas with Common Core Courses

Incite Literacy builds future-ready skills in **language, technology, and operations**—but we don’t ignore the core. Instead, we connect our focus areas directly to traditional subjects like English, math, science, history, and the arts. That way, students can bridge what they *have to learn* with what they *want to do.*

> 🎯 Our goal? Turn school content into *real-world action.*
