# 🔗 Aligning Incite Literacy Focus Areas with Common Core + PBL & DT Frameworks

Each Incite Literacy focus area—**Language**, **Technology**, and **Operations**—supports the skills embedded in **Common Core** standards. Here’s how each one aligns with core courses, and how that alignment can be activated through both **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** and **Design Thinking (DT)**.

---

## 🗣️ Language ↔ English Language Arts (ELA), Social Studies

**Common Core Connection:**
- Reading complex texts  
- Writing clearly and persuasively  
- Conducting research and citing evidence  
- Speaking and listening skills  
- Understanding multiple perspectives (Social Studies tie-in)

> [!tip] **PBL Example**  
> 🎙 *Create a community podcast series that highlights voices from different generations.*  
> - Research community history (Reading/Research)  
> - Write and revise episode scripts (Writing)  
> - Conduct interviews (Speaking & Listening)  
> - Use AI to summarize and organize transcripts (Digital Literacy)

> [!tip] **DT Example**  
> ✍️ *Design a resource that helps new students feel welcome in your community or school.*  
> - Empathize through interviews (Speaking & Listening)  
> - Define the challenge (Perspective-taking)  
> - Prototype materials: flyers, videos, or guides (Writing for purpose)  
> - Use AI tools to enhance layout or visuals (Editing & Drafting Support)

## 💻 Technology ↔ Math, Science, ELA (digital literacy standards)

**Common Core Connection:**
- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking (Math Practice Standards)  
- Scientific inquiry and modeling (NGSS tie-in)  
- Analyzing digital tools and sources (ELA & Tech standards)  
- Interpreting data and making informed decisions

> [!tip] **PBL Example**  
> 🧮 *Build a basic data dashboard that tracks a community need (like food bank usage or public transit access).*  
> - Collect, organize, and analyze data (Math & Science)  
> - Write a report explaining the data trends (ELA)  
> - Use spreadsheet or dashboard tools with AI analysis support (Digital Skills)

> [!tip] **DT Example**  
> 📱 *Prototype a mobile app that helps students stay organized.*  
> - Interview users and identify key needs (Empathy & Inquiry)  
> - Sketch and build a digital mockup (Modeling, Tech Fluency)  
> - Test and revise based on feedback (Math logic + ELA communication)  
> - Use AI to help code or design (AI Integration)

## ⚙️ Operations ↔ Math, Career Readiness, Social Studies

**Common Core Connection:**
- Applying ratios and problem-solving in real-world contexts (Math)  
- Understanding economic systems and decision-making (Social Studies)  
- Planning, organizing, and presenting outcomes (Speaking & Career Readiness)

> [!tip] **PBL Example**  
> 🛍 *Launch a student-run pop-up store or online marketplace.*  
> - Forecast inventory and budget (Math)  
> - Plan logistics and roles (Operations)  
> - Reflect and present what worked and what didn’t (ELA & Speaking)

> [!tip] **DT Example**  
> 📦 *Redesign a school or community process (e.g., recycling, lunch lines, or transportation).*  
> - Observe and document problems (Empathy + Inquiry)  
> - Prototype a better system (Workflow design)  
> - Track time, tasks, and improvements (Planning & Analysis)  
> - Use AI to simulate outcomes or generate proposals (Digital Tools)
