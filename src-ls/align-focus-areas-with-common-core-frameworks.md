# 🔗 Aligning Incite Literacy Focus Areas with Common Core + PBL & DT Frameworks

At Incite Literacy, we build real-world skills through **Language**, **Technology**, and **Operations**. We’re not here to check boxes—but when students solve problems, build products, and tell their stories, they naturally meet (and often exceed) Common Core standards across subjects.

Using **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** and **Design Thinking (DT)**, we help learners move beyond worksheets into work that’s *relevant, rigorous, and real*.

🔹 **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** — for problem-solving and authentic deliverables  
🔹 **Design Thinking (DT)** — for empathy-driven innovation and user-centered design

 🎯 Students don’t just “cover content”—they *use* it to create, build, solve, and lead.

<summary>🚀 <strong>Why This Alignment Matters</strong></summary>

- 📚 **Meets the standards**: Every project touches core competencies across disciplines  
- 🧠 **Boosts retention**: Students *use* content instead of just memorizing it  
- 🛠️ **Builds real skills**: From writing to coding to logistics  
- 🎨 **Values creativity**: Artistic thinking = critical thinking  
- 🤖 **Future-proofs learning**: Students use the same AI tools shaping today’s industries

> 💡 Learning doesn’t have to be either “creative” or “academic.”  
> At Incite Literacy, it’s *both*—and it’s built for what comes next.
