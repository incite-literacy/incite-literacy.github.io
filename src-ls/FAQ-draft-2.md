## 📚 Is this like an online school or course?

No. Incite Literacy is not a traditional school or one-size-fits-all course.

## 🤖 How is AI used at Incite Literacy?

AI is used as a **collaborative tool**—not a replacement for thinking.

We show you how to work with AI *intelligently*, so your ideas and voice stay in the lead.
