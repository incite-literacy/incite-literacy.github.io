# 🤝 Collaboration & Community at Incite Literacy  

At Incite Literacy, you're not learning in isolation.  
You're part of a community that challenges, supports, and grows with you.  

Whether you're working on your first project or refining a big idea, you’ll have space to connect, ask questions, and get feedback—from facilitators and fellow learners alike.  

We believe collaboration sparks better thinking, deeper learning, and more meaningful outcomes.

## 🔄 What Collaboration Looks Like Here

- 💬 **Open Discussions**  
  Join live sessions held twice a week—morning and afternoon—to share ideas, ask questions, or just hear what others are working on. These discussions are optional, flexible, and learner-led.

- 🧑‍🏫 **Facilitator Support**  
  You’re not on your own. Facilitators are here to help you plan, build, and refine your work. You’ll have the option to schedule 1:1 check-ins when you need guidance or want feedback.

- 🧠 **Peer Learning Opportunities**  
  Curious about someone else’s project? Interested in teaming up? You can pitch ideas, join group projects, or simply learn by watching how others approach challenges.

- 💻 **Discourse Forums & Virtual Tools**  
  Stay connected with learners across different time zones and backgrounds. Our online forum makes it easy to ask questions, share wins, and collaborate asynchronously.
