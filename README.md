# Summary

This repository contains the code and material for chuck-stack.org.

Home page is maintained manually in html using picocss.

Source markdown is located in [./src-ls](./src-ls/).

We use mdbook to maintain the published site to [./ls](./ls/).

See ./src-ls/example.md for example markdown artifacts.

md file names:
- Use hyphen '-' to separate words
- Use the first word as a classifier instead of using directories. For example use 'blog-' to start a file name instead of putting the file in a directory named 'blog/'.
- Use singular version of the name (use: best-practice.md -- not: best-practices.md)
