## Quick Interfaces

There are times when users ask for specialized interfaces to perform highly repetitive tasks that cannot be easily accomplished in a terminal. htmx gives users the ability to access existing resources with an optimized interface.

## Maintainable Interfaces

The cheapest part of the development life cycle is the initial development. Ongoing improvements, maintenance and testing tasks create a technical debt that must be paid throughout time. htmx minimizes the cost by its simplicity and synergy with the rest of the chuck-stack.

## Lightweight CSS

htmx combined with [lightweight CSS frameworks](https://github.com/troxler/awesome-css-frameworks?tab=readme-ov-file#very-lightweight) help you create pretty interfaces with minimal effort.
