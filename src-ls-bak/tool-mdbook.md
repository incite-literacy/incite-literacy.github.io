# mdBook

[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is the easiest way to publish your work instructions. It turns markdown files into a static website that is easily searched and consumed by AI.

The list of reasons we love mdBook.

- It is an active project, and it is well documented.
- It is open source.
- It makes publishing work instructions almost trivial.
- It makes the data we need to do our jobs immediately available.
- It can be deployed in every corner of the world.
- It can be deployed in hybrid cloud scenarios.
- It offers a reasonably simple architecture given the nature of its purpose.
- It scales massively for small to medium organizations.
- It does its job (work instruction presentation) quite well.
- And, most importantly it has great synergy with the rest of the chuck-stack.

## chuck-stack Website

Note that the chuck-stack.org website is created using mdBook. Every page after the home page (index.html - which was created with html + picocss) is an mdBook page.

## Obsidian

For those who create lots of work instructions, you might want to use [obsidian](./tool-obsidian.md) to author your markdown files.
