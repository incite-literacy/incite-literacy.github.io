## Dear CEO

Our hope and vision is that all ERP-Like interactions can occur via the CLI (just like ChatGPT or Claude's single text box). Users can either be long-winded or type in cryptic codes. It does not matter because the user gets to communicate the way they want to communicate. The AI will adopt to the human.

We will find and cultivate [Superclerks](./terminology.md#superclerk). These superclerks will effectively reduce headcount. The expectation is that the incremental increase in AI costs is less than the reduction in labor; therefore you will get a net savings. However, it is important to note that the cost savings is not the biggest benefit. The biggest benefit is automation and accuracy. You get to surround yourself with smart people who know how to do/automate their jobs.

The expectation is that we have one set/collection of [work instructions](./best-practices.md) for everyone (humans and AI). The expectation is that AI follows and enforces these work instructions. If humans do not like the work instructions, they submit a change request (just like git - only easier).

It is also worth noting that the chuck-stack.org site is itself a work instruction. The expectation is that the site is the blueprint for building and enhancing the chuck-stack. Said another way, I am writing work instructions for AI and humans at the same time.

To get started, let's find a high-impact and low-effort task to document and automate. Here is an example:

- Scenario name: notify => categorize => extract data => do action
- User shares email or Slack message with a known address
- System reads the message, categorizes and extracts data (example: process order)
- System drafts order and notifies user

Here is what we like about this scenario:

- easy to prototype
- easy to deploy
- easy to measure results

Does this help paint a picture of how to start creating AI success? Thanks again for your support!!!
