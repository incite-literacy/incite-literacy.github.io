## Build AI Co-op Capabilities in Your Community

The purpose of this post is to help fund the improvement of your community through cooperative (co-op) AI understanding and deployment.

We've worked hard to make AI easy to understand, easy to deploy, and easy to scale inside your organization and community. We want to use our abilities to help you raise funds to extend these abilities to your organization and community.

> It is important to note that I am a champion of small to medium organizations. You are my target audience. This post was written for you!

## Problem Statements

Here are the problem statements we want to address:

**Problem #1:** Large organizations are becoming even more powerful with AI.

**Problem #2:** Small and medium organizations are facing rapidly increasing competition from large organizations because of their extended reach.

**Problem #3:** Small communities are facing the same competitive pressures.

**Problem #4:** We have an aging workforce that need to remain relevant and productive, and we need a way to distribute their wisdom and abilities to the balance of your organization or community.

## We Want to Help

The chuck-stack makes technology and AI available to small and medium organizations (including communities). We do this by:

- Publishing an open source framework of well-understood tools that are easy to deploy and scale
- Creating examples of how to use these tools (examples include: [global networking](./blog-incus-netbird-phoenixnap.md) and [AI LLM Dynamic Work Instructions](./blog-llm-ai-production-deploy.md))
- Deploying these tools in a framework of organizational best practices (human resources, quality systems, operations, technology)

All these things are available in the [stack-academy](./stack-academy.md) to support your [local community](./stack-local.md).

## Funding

AI funding and support can come from many places:

- Federal government
- State government
- Local government
- Foundations

One purpose of the stack-academy is to help you apply for, win and deploy funding in your organization and community. If you can find a local funding opportunity, we will help you win it.

## Return of the Co-op

Communities are important. They are created through geographic proximity and shared interests. A purpose built [co-op](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative) goes a long way to support and propel your community. They are easy to create and easy to fund.

We believe that creating a community co-op around AI is one of the best ways to help grow and defend your community. We believe it will help you develop strategic advantages and help ensure local money stays local to your interests.
