## Work Instruction Types

Work instructions are documents that state who does what and how. There are three work instruction types we need to document - that's it!

- `Roles` - responsibilities of a person or system in an organization
- `Tasks` - actions to be performed by one or more roles
- `Tools` - software or mechanical devices used to perform one or more tasks

`Tasks` are easiest work instruction type to start with. It describes how a person or system performs an action. The easiest way to describe tasks is with bullets. Just start writing.

Many of the tasks require the use of tools. You will be tempted to include tool instructions in your tasks. Don't do it!  If you have a task that depends on a tool, reference it so that someone can find the dedicated tool instructions.

Here is a best practices example of a task work instruction referring to a tool:
> Find open orders using the ERP => Sales Order window => "Today's Open Order" search option. <u>Learn more...</u>

In this example, we do not show a picture or screenshot. We do not discuss how to find the ERP. We do not discuss how to navigate. We simply describe the exact destination, and we link to the tool work instructions for further reference.

`Tools` are the next easiest work instructions to document. They simply describe how to navigate, execute, print, etc... The biggest challenge with tools instructions is finding the minimum documentation needed to create success. Error on the side of writing less and test your work instructions. You can always write more later.

Be consistent with how you refer to tool objects. Here are some example guidelines:

- Capitalize the name of a window or menu but lowercase the word 'window'. Example: Sales Order window
- Use quotes to identify a specific item if there is a potential for confusion. Example: Payment Term window => "Net 10" record
- Use breadcrumbs to represent multiple steps. Example: ERP => Sales Order window => Line subtab => Process toolbar => Copy Lines process

`Roles` are some of the most important work instructions to create. Roles describe the contract a person or system has with the organization. It describes what they should or should not do. 

In the [Picture of Success](./picture-success.md), we describe how the role work instructions ensure a [superclerk](./terminology.md#superclerk) does not create anything that violates the role contract. Said another way, properly defined roles give superclerks the freedom to innovate while remaining in the guardrails of their role.

### Where to Write

Before we continue with 'Do what we said we would do', Let's discuss best practices in creating and saving and using your work.

You will be tempted to use Microsoft Word or Google Docs to capture your words. Don't do it! If you do, your words will trapped in that format/container. You will be limited as to how you can use your words with AI or any other tool.

Instead, we strongly recommend you use a tool named [Obsidian](./tools-obsidian.md) as your writing environment. It offers the same joyful writing tools; however, it saves your words in a plain text format called [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Markdown is quite possibly the most simple yet powerful tool you have in working with people and AI.
