# chuck-stack Best Practices

Best practices make the chuck-stack vision possible. This page is broken down into two types of best practices:

1. [Operation](./best-practices-operation.md) - work instructions
2. [Application](./best-practices-application.md)

It is worth noting the chuck-stack.org site was created as an AI-first website, and it is intended be a pinnacle example of how to write documentation for both humans and AI augmentation. Said another way, it should offer a great example of operation and application best practices.
