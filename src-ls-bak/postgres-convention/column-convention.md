# Column Convention

- primary key `uu` - All tables have a single primary key named `uu`. 
- foreign keys `_uu` suffix - example `stk_some_other_table_uu`. There are times when this convention is not possible due to multiple references to the same table. When a duplicate is needed, add an adjective before the `_uu` suffix, preferably on all references to the foreign table. Examples: `stk_bp_ship_to_uu` and `stk_bp_bill_to_uu`.
- noun first column name - when naming columns the noun comes first and the adjective comes next. Example: stk_wf_state_next_uu where state is the noun and next is the adjective. The benefit of this approach is that like columns (and the resulting methods/calls) appear next to each other alphabetically. 
- text column - use columns of type `text` (instead of varchar with unspecified length). Only choose a varchar with a specific length when there is a compelling reason to do so. Even then try not to...
- boolean column - boolean values must have a default value defined at the table level.
- unique index - when creating unique index constraints, name the constraint using the table_name_column_name_uidx where `_uidx` represents the term unique index.

## Standard Columns
These sections list the mandatory and optional columns found in chuck-stack tables. Notice that coding and naming by convention plays a role in primary key name and foreign key relationships. As you will see below, you know the primary key column name as a function of the table name. You know the foreign key table name as a function of the foreign key column name when the convention allows.

### Mandatory Columns

The purpose of this section is to list the columns that appear in every table that holds chuck-stack data.

- primary key - `uu`
- `stk_entity_uu` - financial set of books that owns the record
- `created` - `timestamptz` indicating when the record was created.
- `created_by_uu` - uuid foreign key reference to the database user/role that created the record.
- `updated` - timestamptz indicating when the record was last updated.
- `updated_by_uu` - uuid foreign key reference to the database user/role that last updated the record.
- `table_name` - generated column that hard-codes the name of the table.
- `stk_session_uu` - (not implemented yet) must be set with every insert and update. This tells events (and everything else) what where the details (user,role,docdate, etc...) surrounding this change.

Notes:

- `stk_session` (not implemented yet) records become `is_processed` = true (immutable) after its first use.

### Optional Columns

The purpose of this section is to list the columns you commonly find in chuck-stack tables. Many of the below columns are used in the [sample table](./sample-table-convention.md).

- `is_active` - boolean that indicates if a record can be modified. is_active also acts as a soft-delete. If a record has an is_active=false, the record should be be returned as an option for selection in future lists and drop down fields. This column must be present to update it after the initial save; therefore, it appears in most tables.
- `name` - `text` representing the name of the record.
- `description` - `text` representing the description of the record.
- `search_key` - user defined `text`. The purpose of this column is to allow users to create keys that are more easily remembered by humans. It is up to the implementor to determine if the search_key should be unique for any given table. If it should be unique, the implementor determines the unique criteria. search_key columns are most appropriate for tables that maintain a primary concept but the record is not considered transactional. Examples of non-transactional records include users, business partners, and products.
- `value` - `text` that is often used along with a `search_key` in a key-value pair.
- `docno` - user defined `text`. The purpose of this column is to allow the system to auto-populate auto-incrementing document numbers. It is up to the implementor to determine if the document_no should be unique. If it should be unique, the implementor determines the unique criteria. The document_no column is most appropriate for tables that represent transactional data. Examples of a transaction records include invoices, orders, and payments. Tables that have a search_key column will not have a document_no column. The opposite is also true. <!-- TODO: define and link implementor -->
- `type_enum` - a type table's reference to its enum value. ([see enum and type convetion](./enum-type-convention.md))
- `type_uu` - references the record's associated type record.
- `parent_uu` - references a record in the same table identified as being a parent.
- `record_json` - the record's jsonb column that holds less structured data.
- `table_name_uu_json` - jsonb object referencing `{"table_name": "","uu": ""}`. This is used by services tables (like [attribute tagging](./attribute-tag.md)) to link to the serviced record.
- `is_default` - boolean that indicates if a record should represent a default option. Typically, only one records can have is_default=true; however, there are circumstances where multiple records in the same table can have is_default=true based on unique record attributes. Implementors chose the unique criteria for any given table with a is_default column.
- `date_processed` - timestamptz indicating when the record was processed.
- `is_processed` - boolean derived/generated from `date_processed` automatically indicating if a record has reached its final state. Said another way, if a record's is_processed=true, then no part of the record should updated or deleted. TODO: we need a way to prevent children of processed records to also be assumed to be processed unless the record has its own is_processed column. 
- `is_summary` - boolean that indicates if a record is intended to be a parent to other records in the same table.
- `is_template` - boolean that indicates if a record exists for the purpose of cloning to create new records.
- `is_valid` - boolean that indicates if a record has passed all validators <!-- TODO: define workflow validator - type of event workflow -->
- `is_include` - boolean that indicates if a record is of type include. Including a record could potentially impact all records that are not included. Said another way, including a record could potentially exclude all other records.
- `is_exclude` - boolean that indicates if a record is of type exclude. Excluding a record only impacts that specified record.
- `is_singleton` - indicates that only a single record or object should exist for group or category. Used for example to indicate if more than one attribute tag is allowed for given combination of table_name, uu, stk_attribute_tag_type_uu. If `is_singleton`=Y, then only one instance of an attribute tag type is allowed per record.
- `batch_id` - `text` indicating this record was processed as part of a batch operation. A single record couple participate in multiple batches. if so, use the noun_adjective approach (example: batch_import_id).
- `table_name` - `text` referencing the name of a table. This column is often generated.
- `column_name` - `text` referencing the name of a column.
