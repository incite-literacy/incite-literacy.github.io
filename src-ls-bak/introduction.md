# Introduction

<!-- copied_from_home_page -->
**What makes us special?** <u><i>conversational enterprise computing</i></u> on an open source technology stack... We are tired of ERP's hitting organizations with thousands of barely relevant fields that over complicate processes. We offer a better way for small and medium organizations to manage data, automate processes and build [superclerk](./terminology.html#superclerk) talent.
<!-- /copied_from_home_page -->

chuck-stack is a collection of: 

1. [well understood tools](./stack-tools.md)
1. [organization best practices](./best-practices.md)
1. [application framework](./stack-application.md)

...that puts self-help automation in the hands of the people who actually do the work. With the chuck-stack, everyday clerks use AI and well-formed work instructions to remove complexity and automate tasks. What was tedious becomes scripted. Scripts become menu options. Options connect to form data [pipelines](./terminology.md#data-pipeline).

We transform 20+ person departments of clerks into 2-person teams of [superclerks](./terminology.html#superclerk). We give operational managers the power to guide their teams with just a few words. We ensure those words are considered in every action.

We help organizations focus on what matters most - its people and value proposition to the world.

<!-- keep just in case useful later
**chuck-stack exists to solve a problem:** many (if not most) small to medium organizations do not have the knowledge and resources to automate their processes. This is largely because ERP and most development frameworks are too big, slow, expensive and complicated from almost every perspective (learn, configure, develop, audit, deploy, train, service, scale, enhance, etc...).

## Purpose

The purpose of the chuck-stack is to help organizations:

- Increase operational and transactional velocity and efficiency ([OTVE](./terminology.md#otve))
- Identify and deploy AI-enabled, self-service tools that drive innovation from everyone in your organization
- Build an internal and external community of support and innovation

If we succeed executing our purpose, we will give small and medium sized organizations a competitive advantage against both its peers as well as larger organizations.

## Solution Summary

The chuck-stack consists of three parts:

1. [Collection of Tools](./stack-tools.md): Linux, PostgreSQL, PostgREST, Nushell, AIChat, Zellij, plus more... that all come together to create a full-featured platform. There is no secret or proprietary sauce. Instead, it is pure open source synergy!
1. [Best Practices](./best-practices.md): make the chuck-stack vision possible. These practices include both organizational and technical topics.
1. [Application Framework](./stack-application.md): executing best practices with the above tools and teaching AI to automate the fundamentals of your organization.

## Small and Medium Is Different

It is critical to note that small and medium organization application development is fundamentally different than single-purpose and web-scale application development.

- tools are different
- user needs are different
- developers are different
- deployment is different
- requirements are different
- user training is different

> The majority of the web is filled with single-purpose and web-scale development practices. The world of small and medium organization data and process management is severely underserved. The chuck-stack aims to better support such an important group.

## Education

The stack-academy exists to help your organization achieve success as quickly as possible. It's an online support infrastructure that teaches organizations how to install and use the tools, leverage best practices, and foster [superclerk](./terminology.md#superclerk) talent.

- Teach your technical staff to best introduce the tools with your existing infrastructure.
- Teach your operations team how to best prepare for AI automation and AI safety.
- Teach your users how to start thinking about automation in their role.

## chuck-stack Customers

Deploying enterprise systems is not easy. Small and mid-sized organizations often need additional help to ensure success. We support two types of organizations:

- Integrators - organizations with the specialty of enterprise system deployment and support. These groups often have vertical market expertise that further assist their customers in rapid change management and technology adoption.
- End-users - organizations who will use the chuck-stack in its operations.

Both types of customers are vitally important to ensuring our mutual success. Both customers are welcome and supported in the [stack-academy](./stack-academy.md) and in our community.

## chuck-stack Guiding Principles

Here are the chuck-stack design and implementation first principles in order. If you cannot accomplish these principles, little else matters.

- Protect an organization's revenue stream and people! This needs to be leadership's mantra with any system change.
- Deliver enjoyable systems that a) put the right data in the hands of the right users, b) make the user's job as easy as possible, and c) help users prevent mistakes!
- Deploy infrastructure that is safe, reliable and performant - in that order! If a system is not safe, reliability does not matter. If it is not reliable, performance does not matter.
- Write as little code as is possible. Every line of code is a liability that will cost you in the future. It must be documented, tested, reviewed and maintained. If you can use an existing tool that meets the [chuck-stack guidelines](./stack-tools.md#selection-criteria-summary) in place of writing code, do it!
- Support self service by giving [superclerks](./terminology.md#superclerk) the tools to automate tasks within their roles without direct intervention from IT!

## Why chuck-stack is Important

We keep things simple! There is not much like the chuck-stack on the market. There is NO private equity or venture capitalist manipulating the market or creating a false sense of complexity in hopes of extracting customer profits and executing a windfall chuck-stack sale. 

Instead, the chuck-stack is built on basic fundamentals to make the world a better place for organizations with a purpose. The fundamentals are pretty straight forward:

- Find good tools
- Publish best practices and welcome feedback
- Teach anyone who will listen
- Invest in people worthy of your time and effort
- Strive for continuous improvement
- Tell the truth

We believe in a cooperative approach to learning, support and innovation. We work off of principles, and we collectively create an open source platform that values simplicity, stability and self-service.
