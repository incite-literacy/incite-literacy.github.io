## Why Consider Local chuck-stack

Here is why the chuck-stack matters to your local community:

- As humans, we strive to be relevant.
  - Technology is moving quickly and adoption is difficult.
  - Finding a kind and patient guide to technology (specifically AI) is also difficult.
  - chuck-stack makes technology adoption as easy as possible for small and medium organizations.
- The wealth and power disparity gap is widening across the globe.
  - Large organizations are getting larger.
  - Large organizations are using AI to be everywhere all at once.
  - Small and medium organizations are facing rapidly increasing direct competition from large organizations.
  - Small and medium organizations account for about 96 of all entities around the world.
  - Small and medium organizations are your neighbors.
  - Small and medium organizations are the people who matter to the most to your local community.
  - Small and medium states and countries facing these same threats and challenges from large countries.
- Age and wisdom matter.
  - We have aging workforce.
  - We need this group to remain relevant and productive.
  - We need to support distributing this wisdom and ability to the balance of your organization.
- chuck-stack represents an equalizing force in these emerging imbalances.
  - We make free and open source tools available to everyone in every corner of the globe.
  - We minimize the expertise needed to use AI in your organization.

## Get Started

Let's discuss how to get started supporting your local community. 

1. Begin by identifying someone in your local community to champion this effort.
1. Determine how you wish to start:
    1. [Technology Co-op](#technology-co-op)
    1. [Operational Co-op](#operational-co-op)
    1. [Founding organization(s)](#pick-your-founding-organization)
    1. Some combination of all three

Here is how to get started:

- Purchase a seat in the [stack-academy](./stack-academy.md). You only need one to get started.
- Create a local chuck-stack [benefit entity](#benefit-entity) to amplify your local efforts.
- The stack-academy will help the local benefit entity raise support for more local organizations.
- The local benefit entity will become an expert in supporting the chuck-stack and empower more local organizations.

## Picture of Success

The chuck-stack promotes foundational quality concepts across operations, technology and human resources.

At a minimum, your organizations will learn fundamental best practices. The picture of success means organizations can amplify these best practices using AI to do more, be more and support more of your local community.

What areas of excellence:

- Operational
- Technical
- Human resources

## Foundations in Quality

The minimum your organization will achieve is [quality best practices](./best-practices-operation.md). These are the building blocks to achieve [today's highest standards](./best-practices-operation.md#external-quality-program-breakdown).

We will create a quality standard that adheres to:

- Say what we do
- Do what we said we would do
- Prove that we did it
- Welcome feedback
- Focus on continuous improvement

We will use AI to amplify, augment and automate processes around each of these steps.

## Technology Co-op

One option to get started is to create a local technology co-op. The purpose of the co-op is to provide shared resources for the benefit of local organizations.

Starting the co-op is reasonably simply:

- Purchase a seat in the [stack-academy](./stack-academy.md) - you only need one.
- Find 2 to 3 people from your local community that [fit this description](./blog-chuck-stack-it-job-description-assessment.md).
- Make these people available to your local community in the same way the chuck-stack is organized (open discussion meeting, on-site support, deployment of best practices).

We can help you evaluate and choose your people.

## Operational Co-op

One of the benefits of AI is the decentralization of information and abilities. Said another way, your local community will be able to do more to support itself with less.

There is a reason why Warren Buffet likes to own insurance companies. They are some of the most profitable organizations in the world, and they provide meaningful reserves of cash. The challenge is that running an insurance company relies on the execution of a complex set of rules and regulations.

AI will soon embody these complex abilities (like insurance), and return the ability to keep local funds in local hands. Said another way, AI and the chuck-stack will foster the return of local services supporting local communities.

We need to help local communities develop these local abilities. We need the ability to reason about AI as fast as possible.

## Pick Your Founding Organization

Another option to get started is by finding small or medium organizations in your country, state, or community that represent the types of organizations you want to see excel.

Here are example criteria to help you pick your local small and medium organizations:

- Desire - find organizations to desire to remain relevant in the next decade
- Spirit - find those who can prove a spirit of willingness and innovation
- Basic capabilities - find those to have access to the minimum technology skill needed (Linux and SQL) - or at least the desire and spirit to adobpt

## Funding

The purpose of this section is to discuss local entity funding. AI funding and support can come from many places:

- Federal government
- State government
- Local government
- Foundations

One purpose of the stack-academy is to help your local benefit entity apply for funding to support more local organizations.

[Here is an example](./blog-llm-ai-production-deploy.md) of what everyone should have as the minimum AI capabilities. These are the exact capabilities the above funding agencies are striving to support in their local communities.

We have put in the work to create the examples. We will help you turn the examples into applications for funding.

## Benefit Entity

A benefit entity is a legal organization owned by someone in your community for the benefit of your community. We purposefully use the word 'benefit' as a general term. The actual types of legal entities vary around the world. For example, you may choose a:

- not-for-profit
- for-profit benefit corporation
- co-op
- social purpose corporations
- low-profit limited liability companies (L3Cs)

There are also local certifications that help you assert your entity meets social and environmental standards.

The point is that you should be aware of what types of local entities best serve your community's needs.
