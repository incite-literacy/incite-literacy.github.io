Zellij is a terminal workspace layout engine. Zellij gives the chuck-stack the enterprise 'window' layout capabilities you expect to see in an ERP.

## Why We Love Zellij

Here are the reasons we love Zellij:

- It is an active and welcoming project, and it is well documented.
- It is open source.
- You can get up and running with Zellij in a meaningful way in minutes.
- It does its job (workspace layout) quite well.
- It supports as many layouts as you deem appropriate.
- It supports viewing multiple layout simultaneously. Said another way using an example, you can have three connections using three different layouts on three monitors to helps users better perform their tasks.
- It supports both new users (who often rely on a mouse) as well as advanced users.
- It makes the most of both small and large screens.
- It has great synergy with the rest of the chuck-stack.
