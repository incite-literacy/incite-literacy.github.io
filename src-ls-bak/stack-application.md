# chuck-stack Application Framework

chuck-stack uses [tools](./stack-tools.md) and [best practices](./best-practices.md) to create an application framework for data and process management. The purpose of this page is to describe the chuck-stack application components.

## Framework Goals

Running an organization goes beyond simple CRUD (create, read, update and delete) database operations and running processes. The system needs to make the right tools available to the right person at the right time to make their jobs easier and more enjoyable. 

- Minimize application framework code and complexity by using off-the-shelf tools that are easily deployed and used by people and AI.
- Minimize the effort to create new organization logic. Ideally, a single command will create the template for you. AI will draft the configuration for you.
- Maximize who in an organization can automate organization logic by supporting role-based contracts where role boundaries are well defined and AI can help ensure proper [capability sandboxing](./stack-faq.html#what-is-capability-sandboxing) and data integrity.

## Framework Components

The stack application consists of three components:

1. Tool/role deployment ([see chuck-stack architecture](./stack-architecture.md))
2. Workflow processes
3. Attribute tagging

All three components are critical, and all three components are notoriously difficult to do well. The concepts are difficult to learn. The tools are difficult to install and maintain. It is incredible difficult to create an architecture that is both generic enough and easy enough for broad adoption.

All these statements were true until now. AI changes everything! What was previously tedious is now becoming a conversation. What was previously a black box is now becoming a blueprint for execution.

## Tool/Role Deployment

Assigning the right people and the right tools to the right roles is best discussed in the [stack architecture](./stack-architecture.md).

## Workflow Details

chuck-stack Workflows can be broken down into system and user workflows.

### System Workflows

Here are the important types of system facing workflows.

- Before Events (save, delete, update) - TODO - defined by psql
- After Events (save, delete, update) - TODO - defined by psql
- Functions - TODO - defined by psql
- Interface Events - TODO (singleton or collection)
  - note that interface events can be triggered by user workflows
  - document validation is an example of an interface event

### User Workflows

Here are the important types of user facing workflows.

- Journal workflow - everyone in an organization should be able to record the events in an organization. More...
- Discussion workflow - everyone in an organization should be able to collaborate with others in an organization. More...
- To-do workflow - everyone in an organization should be able to manage a simple list of tasks. More...
- Checklist workflow - roles in an organization often have periodic prescribed tasks. Checklists are a predefined and templated to-do tasks. More...
- Queue workflow - as people manipulate data, some records will reach a state of importance. Queues are defined views into data that match a specific pattern automatically. When the pattern is found, present the user or role with the matching records.  More...
- Notice workflow - events happen, and sometimes users and systems need to be notified. The notification workflow provides information based on the events that occur in an organization.  More...
- Ad-hoc request workflow - users and systems often know what needs to happen and who needs to perform the action based on the events that occur in an organization. This is often referred to as institutional knowledge of action. Ad-hoc request workflows allow users or services to request action from a particular user, role or service.  More...
- Orchestrated request workflow - There are times when an organization needs a formal, multi-step, orchestrated process where a request follows a pre-defined path.

### Document Action Workflows

Document action workflows are simply an implementation of orchestrated request workflows that center around the life cycle of transactional documents such as orders, invoices, receipts, payments, statements, allocations, .... Here is an example life cycle of a Sales Order:

<!-- TODO ensure the Action and Status vocabulary terms are consistent with the pg_workflow repo -->
- Action - Status - Status Description
- Draft - Drafted - initial state representing an idea
- Prepare - Prepared - initial validations pass and it ready for further review
- Submit - Submitted - makes document eligible for downstream action (only applicable to orders to enable receipts, invoices, ...)
- Complete - Completed - terminal status for happy path
- Reverse Correct - Reverse Corrected - terminal status resulting in the creation of an anti-document (with opposite sign) with exact same document date as the original. Both the original and the resulting reversed documents will have the same status.
- Reverse Accrue - Reverse Accrued - terminal status resulting in the creation of an anti-document (with opposite sign) with document date set to a proposed new date. Both the original and the resulting reversed documents will have the same status.

## Attribute Tagging Details

[Attribute tagging](./postgres-convention/attribute-tag.md) is the ability to associate a collection of attribute values with a given record. Any record can have many sets of attribute associated with it. The chuck-stack uses PostgreSQL's JSON capabilities to implement attribute tagging.

Before we get too far, we need to define some terms:

- **Attribute** - a dimension or descriptive characteristic. 
  - Examples include length, width, weight, type, category, Business Partner, ....
- **Attribute Value** - the answer or value associated with an Attribute. 
  - Examples include 10, "100lbs," "order", True, ...
  - Values can also be foreign keys to other tables such as a uuid pointing to a Business Partner table.
- **Attribute Set** - a collection of Attributes.
- **Attribute Set Instance** - an Attribute Set with its Attributes Values assigned.

<!-- TODO: add to terminology.md page - this is the definition and term points here -->

Here is an example of attribute tagging in chuck-stack:

- TODO - this section needs to be moved to conventions
- TODO - need to explain that the psql json capabilities define what is possible. The chuck-stack convention reduces the capabilities to create structure and known practices.
- TODO - need to discuss when to use a table (stk_business_partner) column (stk_payment_term) versus when to use an Attribute Set (instead of a new column).
- There is a table (stk_attribute_set) that points to all dedicated Attribute Set tables
- stk_attribute_set columns:
  - table_name
  - name
  - description
  - json_idx_text - holds the json constraint text that forms the attribute set structure
  - is_valid
  - plus all other mandatory chuck-stack columns
- There is a dedicated table per Attribute Set to hold its Attribute Set Instances (example: stk_attribute_set_contract)
- All dedicated Attribute Set tables have the same columns:
  - table_name
  - record_uu
  - value (holds the json containing the attribute set instance)
  - plus all other mandatory chuck-stack columns

extra:
There are two key process features that make this vision a reality: 1) workflow and 2) attribute tagging.
